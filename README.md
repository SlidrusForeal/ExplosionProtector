# üí£ ExplosionProtector for CoreProtect

**Protect your players‚Äô builds from unwanted explosions**  
A lightweight Spigot/Paper plugin that uses CoreProtect to prevent explosions from destroying blocks placed by players.

---

## üß† Description

`ExplosionProtector` hooks into all types of explosions (TNT, creeper, ender crystal, bed/respawn-anchor explosions, etc.) and checks each affected block‚Äôs origin via the CoreProtect API.  
- **Player-placed blocks** are protected and remain intact.  
- **All other blocks** (natural terrain, plugin-placed, etc.) are destroyed as normal.  
- **TNT chain reactions** are still allowed: TNT will break TNT and natural blocks, but any player-placed block in the blast radius remains safe.

This is ideal for:
- PvE or Creative servers where you want to preserve player builds.  
- Minigame or adventure maps that use TNT but need to protect certain structures.  
- Any world where accidental or malicious explosions should not ruin player work.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Download** the latest `ExplosionProtector.jar`.  
2. Place it into your server‚Äôs `plugins/` directory.  
3. Ensure you have **CoreProtect v10+** installed and enabled.  
4. **Start** or **reload** your server. You should see in console:

## üîÑ Change Log

### [1.1] ‚Äì 2025-04-27
- **CoreProtect Lookup Cache**  
  Added Guava-backed cache to reduce repeated CoreProtect queries and improve performance during big explosions.
- **Multi-Language Support**  
  ‚Ä¢ Extracts all `messages_<lang>.yml` on first run.  
  ‚Ä¢ `config.yml` option `language: <code>`.  
  ‚Ä¢ `/ep language <code>` for on-the-fly language switching.
- **TNT Chain Reaction Handling**  
  Refactored logic so TNT chain reactions still destroy TNT and natural blocks but protect player-placed blocks.
- **Unified Explosion Handlers**  
  Consolidated `EntityExplodeEvent` and `BlockExplodeEvent` logic for consistent protection.
- **Automatic Resource Extraction**  
  Ensures no ‚Äúfile not found‚Äù warnings when all translation files are present in the JAR.
- **Configurable Messages & Clean Code**  
  All user text moved to message files; comments and code streamlined and fully English-documented.

### [1.0] ‚Äì Initial Release
